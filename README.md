# Fetching the data from {JSON} Placeholder fake API

Just type how many object/boxes you want to see from JSON Placeholder API, click "Display" 
button and wait till boxes appear.
Single box includes an ID (number) and title values.

Reset button removes all boxes from the screen and clears input previous value.
